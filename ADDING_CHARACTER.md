# Adding a Character

1. Drop the fbx and friends in Assets/Models/Characters/[MyCharacter]
2. Add the character in Unity as a child of the Characters root GameObject, with position 0, 0, 0
3. Add the Scripts/Character script to the character GameObject
4. Find which child contains the BlendShape, and enter the index of the Top Lid and Bottom Lid, as well as a reasonable Close Value (e.g. 60/40)
